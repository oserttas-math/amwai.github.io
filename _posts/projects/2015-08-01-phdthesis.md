As high-energy nuclear physicists, our goal is to develop a thorough understanding of the phase diagram of nuclear matter. This nuclear phase diagram defines how matter transforms with a change in temperature and/or chemical potential. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of studying the phase diagram, little is known of its features and the form that we use today is derived mainly from conjecture.
To probe the nuclear phase diagram, we collide heavy ions, such as those of lead and gold, in very large and sophisticated machines known as particle colliders. When these ions are first accelerated close to the speed of light, and then suddenly crashed together, the kinetic energy they carry is transformed into heat thereby melting their nucleus. For that brief moment right after collision, the conditions of temperature and matter density experienced by the colliding particles closely resembles the conditions that existed at the beginning of the Universe or what is commonly known as the Big Bang. Recently, scientists have been able to show that in the first few microseconds after collision (which mirrors the first few microseconds of the birth of the Universe), a very short-lived phase of matter consisting of unbound quarks and gluons, the very building blocks of nuclear matter, is formed. This phase of matter is known as a quark gluon plasma or QGP. Eventually, as the matter expands and cools down, it coalesces to form new particles that are then measured by particle detectors such as the PHENIX detector pictured below <pic of PHENIX detector>. Studying the physical properties of these particles can reveal a lot about the initial conditions when the matter was still hot and dense, thereby giving as a vital tool to understanding the nuclear phase diagram.

###My Thesis

One question that has been of great interest to scientists is the location of the critical point of nuclear matter. In thermodynamics, a critical point represents a point in a phase diagram where the different phases exist in equilibrium. It is also the end point of the sharp demarcation line from one phase to another. Matter tends to behave differently in the vicinity of a critical point and therefore one of the strategies been employed by physicists in trying to identify the critical point is to look for sudden changes in behavior as you probe matter at different locations on the phase diagram. For my PhD research, I utilized the very large datasets produced from particle collisions to study how the different systems produced from colliding particles at different energies compare in size. My hypothesis was that in the vicinity of a critical point, we should see a sudden change in the monotonous change in the sizes at different energies, i.e., in the case where you would expect to see a continuous increase in the size of the system produced as you probe at higher and higher energies, a sudden increase in the size would suggest a change in the underlying dynamics of the system as would be expected as the system trajectory traverses a critical point or phase transition line. The analysis involved collecting data, writing and running software programs to select for particles of interest and suppress background, and then looking for interesting correlations. As a result of my work, I was able to significantly narrow down the range in energy (and therefore the location on the phase diagram) that one would expect to find the critical point.

###The PHENIX Collaboration

Particle detectors and the whole business of high-energy nuclear physics is an expensive undertaking, both in terms of infrastructure as well as man-power. For this reason, experiments such as those conducted at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider involve a pooling together of resources from institutions and governments around the world. One such collaboration is the PHENIX collaboration comprising of over 400 scientists and engineers drawn from 12 countries.
